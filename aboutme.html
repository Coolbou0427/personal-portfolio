        <br>
        <p>I am an aspiring programmer who can code in a few languages, and has a lot of experience with many different sorts of tech related projects, problems I had to solve, and all kinds of issues along the way. I like to play video games, do calisthenics, and write fiction in my free time. A lot of times, my hobbies bleed into tech as I want to automate something or make my life easier in many different ways. Whenever someone in my life has a computer issue, they come to me for help. And I love that. Helping people with technology and troubleshooting their devices is what I live for. I live to troubleshoot, and solve problems. </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="centered-text">Abilities</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The languages I can code in are as follows. Python, JavaScript, Html, CSS, and Java. I am familiar with windows server administration, group policy, the Linux operating system, dedicated servers, building computers, website design, versioning through GitHub, and developing software for all kinds of uses. </p>
